During sailing out of San Francisco fine as used to take panorama shot of Golden Gate Bridge. For most of cruise was using my DSLR next time wanted to use my cell phone phone told me had no memory card loaded. Any way tested card my laptop when got back couldn't recognize contacted SanDisk via email provide them copy of my receipt Amazon along serial number back of card (very hard to read) no problems; told me to send them back card they sent me brand new card which now still functioning my cell phone. Great support provide by SanDisk. No hassle as long as can provide proof of purchase (easy to do since Amazon keeps my entire purchase history/invoices online). One reason buy directly Amazon itself vs other vendors (either Amazon elsewhere Internet) have confidence memory cards sold by Amazon itself genuine. there may incredible deals elsewhere internet some cases deals too good to true counterfeit cards being sold.Original review:Just received today. Removed from the packaging inserted into my Samsung Galaxy S3 (Verizon) powered the unit back up the storage was available. No formatting required. Worked the first time out. Settings showed 29.71GB of total space (32GB version) 29.71GB of free space. like the fact that SD adapter came it. Should ever need to insert the card into my laptop will come in handy.

The card worked OK if camera set to resolution lower bit rates. E.g. worked fine 720p protune or 1080p protune off. However 1080p protune (bitrate shy of 6 MB/s mode -- much higher then protune turned off) nothing trouble. Camera would sometime work sometime randomly stop recording for no obvious reason. first suspected camera testing different SD cards ended up being SanDisk's card fault. My spare card old cheap 16GB PNY (also class 10) worked fine under same conditions same camera settings.Once obvious problem card found people GoPro's forums had trouble specific card as well (well always find these only after figure out for yourself right?). Anyhow did some speed tests card by doing simple write of 1GB file full of zeros using Unix dd utility to copy 1GB of zeros /dev/zero (where else would find many zeros ;-) onto file card. The result was average SanDisk's card would manage about 10.2 MB/s. Just barely above bar for class 10 card. However was average over 1GB. During write test speed was oscillating many spikes drops. Drops as low as 7MB/s. Uh. thought write speed of class 10 card should never dip below 10 MB/s? For comparison my old cheap class 10 PNY card was chugging along constant 13 MB/s under same test. No spikes no drops speed.The card will probably work fine most devices as bitrates when recording 1080p video often low enough and/or camera might have huge buffer. if want to use to record video high bitrates your device doesn't have huge buffer to compensate for speed bumps of this card may run into trouble. Be wary of using Hero3 modes have higher bit rates (e.g. 1080p protune enabled).SanDisk's website lists part numbers as SDSDQUI-064G adapter SDSDQUA-064G without adapter. conflicts product description Amazon. While this likely just Amazon not getting product description right again (a bit too common thing) it's interesting to note.[Update Apr 20 2013]:Some numbers testing card. The test extremely simple. Write out 1GB of zeros onto card using standard Unix dd command to read 128KB blocks of zeroes special device /dev/zero write onto card. 128KB * 8192 = 1GB. dd displays transfer stats once finishes. While dd was running run iostat second terminal displaying 1 second interval stats as measure of current speed. was done the Mac. dd command line can used as-is to repeat test Linux system however iostat command different Linux would need to modified slightly. choose 128KB block size as that seems to what device drivers merges sequential writes into anyhow.

Just as other Samsung products Galaxy Tab 4 has ability to add microSD card to expand memory device. Since it's been over year decided to do some more research to see if SanDisk offered anything new. As of 6/19/2014 their product lineup for microSD cards worst to best (performance-wise) as follows:SanDiskSanDisk UltraSanDisk Ultra PLUSSanDisk ExtremeSanDisk Extreme PLUSSanDisk Extreme PRONow difference between all of these cards simply speed which can read/write data to card. Yes published rating of most all these cards (except SanDisk regular) Class 10/UHS-I that's rating... Actual real world performance does get better each model faster cards come more expensive prices. Since Amazon doesn't carry Ultra PLUS model of microSD card had to do direct comparisons between SanDisk Ultra ($34.27) Extreme ($57.95) Extreme PLUS ($67.95).As mentioned my earlier review purchased SanDisk Ultra for my Galaxy S4. My question did want to pay over $20 more for card faster than one already owned? Or could pay almost double to get SanDisk's 2nd-most fastest microSD card.The Ultra works perfectly fine for my style of usage (storing/capturing pictures & HD video movie playback) my phone. end ended up buying another SanDisk Ultra 64GB card. use my cell phone *more* than do my tablet if card good enough for my phone it's good enough for my tablet. don't own 4K HD camera anything so honestly didn't see need to get one of faster cards time.I am now proud owner of 2 SanDisk Ultra cards have 0 issues my Samsung devices.[[ ORIGINAL REVIEW - 5/1/2013 ]]I haven't had to buy microSD card long time. The last time bought one for my cell phone over 2 years ago. since my cellular contract up knew would have to get newer card addition to my new phone Samsung Galaxy S4. Reason for because knew my small 16GB microSD card wasn't going to cut it.Doing research Galaxy S4 wanted to get best card possible had decent capacity (32 GB greater). led me to find Galaxy S4 supports microSDXC Class 10 UHS-I card which fastest possible given class. Searching for specifically Amazon gave me results of only 3 vendors (as of April) makes these microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 cards. They Sandisk (the majority) Samsung Lexar. Nobody else makes these sold Amazon.Seeing how SanDisk pretty good name out of 3 (I've used them most) decided upon SanDisk because Lexar overpriced Samsung one overpriced (as well as not eligible for Amazon Prime).But scary when filter by SanDisk get DOZENS of options. All of them have different model numbers different sizes etc. Then there's confusion of what's difference between SDHC & SDXC?SDHC vs SDXC:SDHC stand for ""Secure Digital High Capacity"" SDXC stands for ""Secure Digital eXtended Capacity"". Essentially these two cards same exception SDHC only supports capcities up to 32GB formated FAT32 file system. The SDXC cards formatted with exFAT file system. If use SDXC card device must support file system otherwise may not recognizable and/or have to reformat card to FAT32.FAT32 vs exFAT:The differences between two file systems means FAT32 has maximum file size of 4GB limited by file system. exFAT otherhand supports file sizes up to 2TB (terabytes). The only need to know really it's possible your device doesn't support exFAT. If that's case reformat to FAT32. REMEMBER FORMATTING ERASES ALL DATA!To clarify model numbers hopped over to SanDisk official webpage. What found there that offer two ""highspeed"" options for SanDisk cards. These SanDisk Extreme Pro SanDisk Ultra. SanDisk Extreme Pro a line that supports read speeds up to 95MB/sec however are SDHC only. To make things worse are currently only available 16GB & 8GB capacities. Since one of my requirements to have a lot of storage ruled these out.The remaining devices listed Amazon's search the SanDisk Ultra line. here confusion sets because SanDisk separates these cards to two different devices. Cameras & mobile devices. Is there a real difference between the two is this a marketing stunt? Unfortunately not sure do know the price difference between the two range a couple cents to a few dollars. Since wasn't sure opted for the one specifically targeted for mobile devices (just in case there is some kind of compatibility issue). To find the exact model number would go to Sandisk's webpage (sandisk.com) compare their existing product lineup. From there you get exact model numbers you can then search Amazon for these model numbers. That is how got mine (SDSDQUA-064G).As for speed tests haven't run any specific testing copying 8 GB worth of data my PC to the card literally took just a few minutes.One last note is that Amazon attaches additional characters to the end (for example SDSDQUA-064G-AFFP-A vs SDSDQUA-064G-U46A). The difference between the two is that the ""AFFP-A"" means ""Amazon Frustration Free Packaging"". Other than that these are exactly the same.

The card came formatted FAT32.I read web about these micro SDs apparently not as fast as full SD card version. borrowed my brothers Sandisk 32gb full SD card to make comparison tests. Here my official/unofficial test results using DiskBench V2.6.2.0 H2testw 1.4 test. will give results as ""overall"" result because after testing these cards over over speed writes reads results get mixed varied to big degree... much larger than expected numerous tests showed me ""general"" trend. The trend full SD cards do write faster than MicroSD card. also remember microSD had to put into adapter to do test my PC while fullSD card put into computer reader directly.These are just my averages but:Small file writes:Both SD cards wrote close to 10mb/sec. The microSD less consistent tests sometimes dropped to 8mb/sec.Small file reads:Both SD cards read close to 20 mb/sec their fastest.Large file copies to card:MicroSD wrote 3.5mb/sec while fullSD wrote about 4mb/secLarge file reads copies card:MicroSD 10mb/sec while fullSD read about 14mb/sec.My conclusion:My tests by no means official for card showed much variance dependent file size of the reads writes the fullSD card faster many cases equal to microSD most cases. The small file writes reads showed are similar enough. my only concern large file writes.... 3.5 mb/sec good enough for rapid photography high pixel camera? don't know. have had no problem using these cards with H264 movie capture for hours. am surprised 3.5 mb/sec is enough.Also never during the huge file copies to the card did get any noticeable heating of the card itself by touch even for hour. noticed it has been complaint many people the web some stating felt they might burn themselves. copied files that took more than hour with no noticeable temperature change other than perhaps a couple of degrees. Of course was a PC not installed a camera.The card performs well for video work appears to meet many other tests performed by other people. never saw a read close to 30 mb/sec... they consistent 20 mb/sec the highest performance.I would get the card again if the price were right.",4.0,Good Card,1350691200,2012-10-20,779,1,2AZZNHVT9AH73R,B007WTAJTO,Lazer G.,"[0, 0]","Not much to say about but was definitely worth buy. comes w/ small case to hold both itself the adapter.

They initially went sale for about $17.95 $34.95 for 32 64 respectively. watched them slowly increase price random dips peaks for month. On January 6th 2014 still show as &#34;Best Deal Amazon&#34; for &#34;7 more days&#34; they highest price point since last summer -- higher than have *ever* payed for these cards! don't let &#34;Best Deals&#34; section deceive at $27/$50 these NOT &#34;deal&#34; terms of price.Okay here's my actual &#34;review&#34; of these great SDXC cards.****I have tried variety of MicroSDXC cards so far Samsung Ultra UHS1 best -- price can't beat -- for all most important reasons: speed capacity reliability durability.I have not had single failure use these cards my Nook HD+ Nexus 7 2013 (via USB) my Canon 5D Mark II (with converter) MacBook Pro (In card slot). They're durable waterproof can use same card all these devices without reformatting. even had one go through wash I still use for pictures.For technically inclined I have cards *both* Clockwork Mod bootloader (for Nook HD+) MagicLantern firmware for my Canon EOS 5D II the same card. I can pull from the Nook shoot pictures the camera look at the results the Nook by pulling the card out of one device and placing the other. should possible any SDXC/SDHC card it turns out the Samsung UHS1 the only card found works reliably.

One disturbing trend noticed that: speed class rating for micro-SDHC typically inflated. For example 'class-10' rating means card must deliver sequential write speed of least 10MB/s. somehow class-10 microSDHC cards always slower than class-10 SDHC card same manufacturer. Case point: thePNY 32 GB microSDHC Card (P-SDU32G10-EFS2)claims to 'class-10' yet can only write 8.6MB/s maximum while full-sizePNY P-SDHC16G10achieved 13.4MB/s according to CrystalDiskMark v3.01.ThisSanDisk Ultra 32 GB microSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 card (SDSDQUA-032G-U46A) however proves to exception. achieved sequential write speed of over 10MB/s according to two different benchmark programs (11.8MB/s ""CrystalDiskMark"" 10.6MB/s ""H2testw v1.4""). faster than all my other microSDHC cards including two 'class-10' cards fromPNYandPolaroid.A closer look file transfer speed using ""Flash Memory Toolkit"" revealed another nice surprise: For writing small files Sandisk Ultra microSDHC card performed as well as its full-size counterpart theSanDisk Ultra SDHC (SDSDU-032G-AFFP). In contrast all my other class-10 microSDHC cards perform poorly while writing smaller files. See benchmark results uploaded to 'Customer Images' for details.When use memory card digital camera to record HD video needs to store a huge video file each session. That means its sequential write speed most critical. When used a tablet a smart phone however card's random write speed for small files more important. That's why such applications Sandisk microSDHC will perform faster than PNY Polaroid cards even though also rated as 'class-10'.[Bottom Line]As of writing Sandisk Ultra microSDHC card ia actually priced lower than other class-10 cards PNY Polaroid. makes Sandisk best value - especially if need honest class-10 performance across all platforms.[Side Notes]- Do not confuse Sandisk Ultra card withSanDisk Mobile Ultra microSDHC (SDSDQY-032G-U46A). The latter rated for class-6 only.- The size of '32GB' card 29.7GB according to my computer. actually normal because computer people count one Gig as ""2 to power 30"" which 7.3% larger than one billion. 29.7GB translates to 31.9 billion bytes which is '32GB' according to marketing people.[Update Feb 4 2013]1. Amazon combined Sandisk Ultra 32GB 64GB cards same product page. Please beware your intended appliance must compatible 'SDXC' order to used 64GB version. My original review refers to 32GB 'SDHC' version.2. There two part numbers for same card. If start Amazon product page select 'Retail Packaging' you'll see the part number of SDSDQUA-032G-U46A. if click 'Frustration Free Package' the part number changes to SDSDQU-032G-AFFP-A.[Update Oct 5 2013]The Sandisk microSDHC card works great my new Samsung Galaxy S3 without the need for reformat (the default format is FAT32)[Update Dec 26 2013]My old test results limited by the card reader USB 2.0 port used. re-tested the Sandisk UHS1 micro card using theTranscend RDF5 Card Readerconnected to USB 3.0 port.

(Read below)Firstly need to aware Samsung Tablet Model GT-P5113 currently runs Android OS 4.1.1 Kernel 3.0.31-523998 Build number JRO03C.P5113UECLK7.(Jelly Bean) My experiences shared level of Android OS your experiences may vary depending what version of OS are running. The SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC card purchased Amazon (Retail Packaging) gets recognized fine however when tablet's Media Device A.K.A 'MTP' application attempts to talk your PC via USB cable Tablet simply reboots! after card presented to PC. - Really strange indeed!This baffled me for couple of hours. Firstly attempted to format card (exFAT) PC formatted fine. After I attempted to use tablet to see same behavioral oddity of instantaneous reboot of tablet as 'MTP' application tries to communicate PC. made me investigate issue further I determined root cause fact SANDISK now seen to factory format card 'exFAT' also somehow seen to include 'offset' of 16MB beginning of card which shows up as 16MB unallocated region initial sectors card under windows disk management tool.The solution to get rid of 'unallocated' 16MB partition card. You could do PC might require some windows command line experience using 'diskpart' utility what not I do not want to confuse people process. For most novice users The process should very simple Just insert card the tablet use the 'native' SD Card format tool under 'settings' Android OS 4.1.1 has it will get rid of 16MB partition happily remount Now after this simple process the 'MTP' application works fine with PC to transfer files to the SD card without any strange reboot phenomenon.Not sure why SANDISK formats their Class 10 card this fashion (They never did it with their class 6 cards earlier) there's gotta some technical explanation for why include 16MB partition that only SANDISK can give. In the end if reformat the card in the tablet (Which defaults to exFAT) the card seen to work fine.Bottomline:-----------This an awesome 64GB capacity MicroSD card reputed manufacturer for budget minded people gets the job done beautifully. The read write speeds are adequate enough for most AudioVideo & picture file formats in a tablet. The glitch mentioned above forced me to give *Four* stars instead of *Five* stars let that not stop you from making a decision to buy it.Highly recommended!Cheers!",4.0,Works with GT-P5113 Samsung Tab 2!,1370390400,2013-05-06,581,2,2A1K9VV4RV5E7PH,B007WTAJTO,R.

Believe me tried everything Google searches returned as solutions... formatting as exFAT formatting GS4 then copying data to card while phone etc.... nothing worked... so now please stop pulling out your hair hopefully will get same result which hope to get soon (just RMA'd will send back tomorrow for free replacement under warranty).The problem (As confirmed SanDisk customer support rep when asked specifically asked him):- When used GS4 card will unmount itself inadvertently (may true only for cards manufactured before ROM patch described below implemented manufacturing). can cause data to become corrupt (luckily not my experience) / can frustrating as most of us saving 13 MP camera pictures to card (or MP4 movies stop middle of movie) unmounts when view picture gallery worse right when take picture (this issue experienced).- SanDisk knows about issue. Again SANDISK KNOWS ABOUT THE ISSUE AND WILL REPLACE YOUR CARD. Call them (info below) WILL take care of under warranty. They have good name for reason want to keep (sorry SanDisk about 1 star thought way to get message out to those searching for solution)- The customer rep told me SanDisk tried to work Samsung to resolve issue Samsung refused to acknowledge problem exists card some of their phones (especially their flagship GS4 phones).- The customer rep told me to their knowledge card works fine regular cameras (not Samsung GS4 phones cameras obviously) even worked fine some phones HTC etc. could accommodate 64 GB cards. Hence 5 star ratings others.- The solution SanDisk came up to write patch into ROM of card itself to specifically address issue Samsung GS4 phones (and maybe other Samsung phones GS3). assured new card would get would work flawlessly. will see about 3 weeks.- purchased my card Amazon June 2013 so ones currently being manufactured one should get will have new patch. However as SanDisk manufactures batches (like most of industry) old batches of ""unpatched"" cards obviously exist warehouses.- asked about software patch could download told it's not possible... hence ""hard coded patch"" card's ROMSo... how to take care of problem....After speaking SanDisk US customer support (link info below) what learned did.Go to SanDisk site1) [...]2) call consumer products support (this US no.) 1-866-SANDISK (726-3475)3) Tell them card unmounting itself your GS4 (I assume also problem experienced by GS3 owners too)4) They will then confirm your information approve your return (10-15 min approval window by mine basically instantaneously) then send emails UPS return label instructions.5) BTW also asked if had magnifying glass to ID serial no. card didn't couldn't read myself (those numbers super small printed into plastic... don't me? take look yourself.) told rep couldn't read them said no problem would process without serial no. assume because send new replacement card only when they receive your card send in. Makes sense.Well that's Problem (hopefully) solved. Let's see 2-3 weeks. The rep was super nice about seemed they all too familiar problem. KUDOS TO SANDISK FOR TAKING CARE OF IT... however would nice if there was some type of communication / notice of issue besides Google info sources forums etc. spent hours maybe couple of days total hours worth thinking was issue my phone / my data transfer. oh well that's how goes.I hope review helps some of out there same problem as me. GOOD LUCK!!(btw I'd give card 5 stars if problem was solved patched ROM of newer cards as data transfer speeds awesome card (tested transferring data via card reader hooked to my computer)... if data transfer / remaining mounted GS4 issue never existed (pre-patch of ROM of course))UPDATE: 08/17/2013 - All went well return of the SanDisk Storage card. UPS shipping took about 2 days when sent SanDisk verified the warranty claim 1 day later 5 hours later same day my replacement card had been shipped. waiting the new card now expect to test out soon (early next week). will update the post after testing out the new card. Just as reference been using 32GB Micro SD HC SanDisk card the GS4 since having shipped the 64GB card. Obviously it's different card not the Micro SD XC kind. Other than bit slower access speeds to the card zero problems.... well if don't count it's basically filled up hence why the 64GB option great the GS4. proves the point the problem the early build Micro SD XC 64GB cards.I'm happy to see my review has helped some others out there. Good luck to your warranty claim. my experience SanDisk customer support has been excellent so far.Update: 08/21/2013 - Received the new replacement SanDisk Storage card few days ago (shipping back to me once they agreed was defective was short time window). Have had running the Galaxy S4 for few days now without any jumps stutters card unloading the middle of picture video taking. Card seems to work flawlessly as the SanDisk Rep mentioned would. One would it's such a short time to test after a few days of use if were not fixed already would have dismounted the first 45 minutes... that's how often how fast was occurring. so would seem the problem is solved. The new SD card makes the phone even more responsive when moving between pictures the gallery performing other tasks copying files to the card. Thanks SanDisk! Unless update review by next week will know the problem has been fixed.Good luck to those similar problems as we now know how to get fixed thanks to SanDisks great responsive customer service.Update: 08/31/2013 - is the last update to review to ""close the loop"". The new replacement card SanDisk has been running flawlessly for about 2 weeks now. have not experienced any of the initial problems. SanDisk did fix the issues the new batch of cards.Update: 12/09/2013 - The card has been running in my GS4 flawlessly since replacing around Aug 21st. Pretty good track record so far (~ 3.5 months) so appears to fixed the newly manufactured (replacement) cards.For those have left comments should change the rating upwards now the issue is fixed (see my addition the beginning of this review)... When searching for a solution to a problem a purchased product most people start the 1 star reviews to see what others have experienced. is especially true for products a lot of reviews (this is what I did in the beginning this product). Therefore I think leaving 1 star adding the comments at the beginning should clarify the review.Thanks to review commenter ""Da Shocker"" for his input.

All my files created Win XP Win Vista - FAT32. also have Win7 machine recently purchased can easily move all types of files between all machines memory cards flash drives could not transfer any files to card any computer as long as card was formatted exFAT32. had read internet about reformatting cards working. My Win7 machine does not even have option to format to standard FAT32 only has NSTF exFAT32. My older computers have older FAT32 format option took my Vista computer Dual Core processor 1 hours to reformat card to FAT32. After reformatting was able to easily transfer my files photos videos my XP Vista computers BUT not Win7 computer. The card works my tablet am able to access use all files transferred to card FAT32 my Vista computer tablet. BUT after reformatting now the card only has 27GB of space available so was essentially reformatted the 64GB card into 32GB card. will keep the card because have a lot of work into reformatting transferring files hopefully the future can reformat it again back to exFAT32 if when exFAT32 catches OS made can seamlessly use files created both FAT32 exFAT32. seems to a good card works well certain situations my advice do your research what have how will use the card because not simply a big GB card can used for everything every device unless ALL your files photos videos will created exFAT32 there are some real draw backs to card might better off just buying multiple lower GB cards if really need much storage space in a Micro SD card. Or perhaps cards you already own can reformatted into exFAT32 double the capacity if your computer has the exFAT32 reformat option. have not tried it based my experience the last few days it seems it would work if exFAT32 works for you. I gave 3 stars because it does work but I feel Sandisk not fully explaining how are getting 64GB out of this card and the possible problems a consumer might have it is misleading advertising.",3.0,Works but BEWARE exFAT32,1376956800,2013-08-20,475,1,1A346NWHW7LJAND,B007WTAJTO,T.

These cards intentionally crippled by design.To quote a friend:""Per the SDHC standard the format is FAT32. SDXC (64 GB larger) the spec calls for exFAT. Microsoft has limited the OS to only format larger cards as exFAT will not allow FAT32. Also seems they have found a way to also block NTFS.
