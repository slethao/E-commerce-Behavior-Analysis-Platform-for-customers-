In May of 2013 while my cruise to Alaska card went bad. During sailing out of San Francisco fine as used to take panorama shot of Golden Gate Bridge. For most of cruise using my DSLR next time wanted to use my cell phone phone told me had no memory card loaded. Any way tested card my laptop when got back couldn't recognize contacted SanDisk via email provide them copy of my receipt Amazon along serial number back of card (very hard to read) no problems; told me to send them back card sent me brand new card which now still functioning my cell phone. Great support provide by SanDisk. No hassle as long as can provide proof of purchase (easy to do since Amazon keeps my entire purchase history/invoices online). One reason buy directly Amazon itself vs other vendors (either Amazon elsewhere Internet) have confidence memory cards sold by Amazon itself genuine. there may incredible deals elsewhere internet some cases deals too good to true counterfeit cards being sold.Original review:Just received today. Removed packaging inserted into my Samsung Galaxy S3 (Verizon) powered unit back up storage available. No formatting required. Worked first time out. Settings showed 29.71GB of total space (32GB version) 29.71GB of free space. fact SD adapter came Should ever need to insert the card into my laptop will come handy. (yes can plug my phone directly to my laptop if ever swap 32GB card out of my phone replace with 64GB version can use 32GB version via the adapter for other purposes.)",3.0,ready for use on the Galaxy S3,1346803200,2012-05-09,943,0,0

A1UM44ILLZCEI1,B007WTAJTO,Aleksandar Milivojevic,"[0, 0]",bought 64GB version of card to use GoPro Hero 3 black edition. didn't work out. The card worked OK if camera set to resolution lower bit rates. E.g. worked fine 720p protune 1080p protune off. However 1080p protune (bitrate shy of 6 MB/s mode -- much higher then protune turned off) nothing trouble. Camera would sometime work sometime randomly stop recording for no obvious reason. first suspected camera testing different SD cards ended up being SanDisk's card fault. My spare card old cheap 16GB PNY (also class 10) worked fine under same conditions same camera settings.Once obvious problem card found people GoPro's forums had trouble specific card as well (well always find these only after figure out for yourself right?). Anyhow did some speed tests card by doing simple write of 1GB file full of zeros using Unix dd utility to copy 1GB of zeros /dev/zero (where else would find many zeros ;-) onto file card. The result average SanDisk's card would manage about 10.2 MB/s. Just barely above bar for class 10 card. However average over 1GB. During write test speed oscillating many spikes drops. Drops as low as 7MB/s. Uh. thought write speed of class 10 card should never dip below 10 MB/s? For comparison my old cheap class 10 PNY card chugging along constant 13 MB/s under same test. No spikes no drops speed.The card will probably work fine most devices as bitrates when recording 1080p video often low enough and/or camera might have huge buffer. if want to use to record video high bitrates your device doesn't have huge buffer to compensate for speed bumps of card may run into trouble. Be wary of using Hero3 modes have higher bit rates (e.g. 1080p protune enabled).SanDisk's website lists part numbers as SDSDQUI-064G adapter SDSDQUA-064G without adapter. conflicts product description Amazon. While likely Amazon not getting product description right again (a bit too common thing) it's interesting to note.[Update Apr 20 2013]:Some numbers testing card. The test extremely simple. Write out 1GB of zeros onto card using standard Unix dd command to read 128KB blocks of zeroes special device /dev/zero write onto card. 128KB * 8192 = 1GB. dd displays transfer stats once finishes. While dd running run iostat second terminal displaying 1 second interval stats as measure of current speed. was done Mac. dd command line can used as-is to repeat test Linux system however iostat command different Linux would need to modified slightly. choose 128KB block size as seems to what device drivers merges sequential writes into anyhow.

SanDisk so clearly guilty of selling defective product batch about 6 months ago. Which as said before when put them super discount sale. They knew what doing thumbing their nose customers who fell outside warrantee (like myself).To knowingly sell your customer something going to fail unacceptable rate then ignore them because failed little bit outside warrantee bad faith. beg people considering buying product to not do so thumb up reviews warning of failures. only when companies lose sales do reconsider not screwing their customers this.Personally have bought several SanDisk thumb drives CompactFlash cards Sandisk MP3 player.

Just as other Samsung products Galaxy Tab 4 has ability to add microSD card to expand memory device. Since it's been over year decided to do some more research to see if SanDisk offered anything new. As of 6/19/2014 their product lineup for microSD cards worst to best (performance-wise) as follows:SanDiskSanDisk UltraSanDisk Ultra PLUSSanDisk ExtremeSanDisk Extreme PLUSSanDisk Extreme PRONow difference between all of these cards simply speed which can read/write data to card. Yes published rating of most all these cards (except SanDisk regular) Class 10/UHS-I that's rating... Actual real world performance does get better each model faster cards come more expensive prices. Since Amazon doesn't carry Ultra PLUS model of microSD card had to do direct comparisons between SanDisk Ultra ($34.27) Extreme ($57.95) Extreme PLUS ($67.95).As mentioned my earlier review purchased SanDisk Ultra for my Galaxy S4. My question did want to pay over $20 more for card faster than one already owned? Or could pay almost double to get SanDisk's 2nd-most fastest microSD card.The Ultra works perfectly fine for my style of usage (storing/capturing pictures & HD video movie playback) my phone. end ended up buying another SanDisk Ultra 64GB card. use my cell phone *more* than do my tablet if card good enough for my phone it's good enough for my tablet. don't own 4K HD camera anything so honestly didn't see need to get one of faster cards time.I am now proud owner of 2 SanDisk Ultra cards have 0 issues my Samsung devices.[[ ORIGINAL REVIEW - 5/1/2013 ]]I haven't had to buy microSD card long time. The last time bought one for my cell phone over 2 years ago. since my cellular contract up knew would have to get newer card addition to my new phone Samsung Galaxy S4. Reason for because knew my small 16GB microSD card wasn't going to cut it.Doing research Galaxy S4 wanted to get best card possible had decent capacity (32 GB greater). led me to find Galaxy S4 supports microSDXC Class 10 UHS-I card which fastest possible given class. Searching for specifically Amazon gave me results of only 3 vendors (as of April) makes these microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 cards. They Sandisk (the majority) Samsung Lexar. Nobody else makes these sold Amazon.Seeing how SanDisk pretty good name out of 3 (I've used them most) decided upon SanDisk because Lexar overpriced Samsung one overpriced (as well as not eligible for Amazon Prime).But scary when filter by SanDisk get DOZENS of options. All of them have different model numbers different sizes etc. Then there's confusion of what's difference between SDHC & SDXC?SDHC vs SDXC:SDHC stand for ""Secure Digital High Capacity"" SDXC stands for ""Secure Digital eXtended Capacity"". Essentially these two cards same exception SDHC only supports capcities up to 32GB formated FAT32 file system. The SDXC cards formatted exFAT file system. If use SDXC card device must support file system otherwise may not recognizable and/or have to reformat card to FAT32.FAT32 vs exFAT:The differences between two file systems means FAT32 has maximum file size of 4GB limited by file system. exFAT otherhand supports file sizes up to 2TB (terabytes). The only need to know it's possible your device doesn't support exFAT. If that's case reformat to FAT32. REMEMBER FORMATTING ERASES ALL DATA!To clarify model numbers hopped over to SanDisk official webpage. What found there offer two ""highspeed"" options for SanDisk cards. These SanDisk Extreme Pro SanDisk Ultra. SanDisk Extreme Pro line supports read speeds up to 95MB/sec however SDHC only. To make things worse currently only available 16GB & 8GB capacities. Since one of my requirements to have lot of storage ruled these out.The remaining devices listed Amazon's search SanDisk Ultra line. confusion sets because SanDisk separates these cards to two different devices. Cameras & mobile devices. Is there real difference between two marketing stunt? Unfortunately not sure do know price difference between two range couple cents to few dollars. Since wasn't sure opted for one specifically targeted for mobile devices (just case there some kind of compatibility issue). To find exact model number would go to Sandisk's webpage (sandisk.com) compare their existing product lineup. From there get exact model numbers can then search Amazon for these model numbers. That how got mine (SDSDQUA-064G).As for speed tests haven't run any specific testing copying 8 GB worth of data my PC to card took a few minutes.One last note Amazon attaches additional characters to end (for example SDSDQUA-064G-AFFP-A vs SDSDQUA-064G-U46A). The difference between two that ""AFFP-A"" means ""Amazon Frustration Free Packaging"". Other than that these exactly same. If you're wondering what got (and want to use in your Galaxy S4) got SDSDQUA-064G-u46A works charm.",5.0,UPDATED - Great w/ Galaxy S4 & Galaxy Tab 4 10.1 - No Complaints Here!!!,1367366400,2013-01-05,702,1952,2020

With new card almost any single file (even hundreds of megabytes big) instant transfer transfers too quick to even bring up &#34;moving&#34; dialog box Windows 8.

Now can procrastinate even longer occasional transfers of all my pictures videos to my PC though try not to.A lot of phones (like my S4) specify 64GB SDXC cards as maximum support so is about best can even get for moment unless want to pay almost double for SanDisk's Extreme cards.

Here my official/unofficial test results using DiskBench V2.6.2.0 H2testw 1.4 test. will give results as ""overall"" result because after testing these cards over over speed writes reads results get mixed varied to big degree... much larger than expected numerous tests showed me ""general"" trend. The trend full SD cards do write faster than MicroSD card. also remember microSD had to put into adapter to do test my PC while fullSD card put into computer reader directly.These just my averages but:Small file writes:Both SD cards wrote close to 10mb/sec. The microSD less consistent tests sometimes dropped to 8mb/sec.Small file reads:Both SD cards read close to 20 mb/sec their fastest.Large file copies to card:MicroSD wrote 3.5mb/sec while fullSD wrote about 4mb/secLarge file reads copies card:MicroSD 10mb/sec while fullSD read about 14mb/sec.My conclusion:My tests by no means official for card showed much variance dependent file size of reads writes fullSD card faster many cases equal to microSD most cases. The small file writes reads showed similar enough. my only concern large file writes.... 3.5 mb/sec good enough for rapid photography high pixel camera? don't know. have had no problem using these cards H264 movie capture for hours. am surprised 3.5 mb/sec enough.Also never during huge file copies to card did get any noticeable heating of card itself by touch even for hour. noticed has been complaint many people web some stating felt might burn themselves. copied files took more than hour no noticeable temperature change other than perhaps couple of degrees.

Since then have inserted back camera reformatted (like always should) bam one photo good after failure every single time. now have 64GB card capable of taking storing ONE PHOTO time before must run ""fix file system"" my computer.Don't waste your money card over priced not faster than other cards have zero longevity. may one off problem created by proprietary format exFAT makes card loser more to point poor customer who buys it.UPDATE JULY 2012After contacting sandisk have offered RMA first must verify have not tried to ""recover"" ""wipe"" data card must ship my expense to Taiwan. have since emailed them reply to requested information (date of purchase photos of card packaging ect) told them data their my data if could have accessed card would have wiped why should give them my information stored card? That makes me less than happy am guessing want to discourage returns. Who would want to send data to company not knowing who will access what will do information contained? would have wiped card unreadable unable to format unable to do anything. will send to them hoping information destroyed along bad card.Sandisk asking whole lot of your customers since card has gone bad have had several other cards them go bad as well seems to whole lot of cards being shipped die short time periods. used to love their products their older flash drives great still using micro cruzer 6 years old going strong. have not had one single microSD card company last more than three months since moved to Philippines. Either send their junk to Philippines have dropped QC their business model to create higher profit margins.**UPDATE 2**After emailing Sandisk expressing my displeasure having to return item intact so can ""assess"" card look at/recover what ever personal information may have been stored card rescinded. can only assume want to get card back to verify bad make sure not trying to get free card out of them which can understand. Instead of requiring me to send card back to them asked cut card send photo of ""destroyed"" card so could process new card to sent to me directly Philippines. hammered them pretty hard review email sent to them regarding bad card sometimes get results case give them 5 stars for doing right thing. had no problem cutting card since would not operate any of my devices did have problem returning device intact out knowing what information stored card (banking amazon account info passwords ect.) would have kept card destroyed never bought another sandisk.

DO NOT pay any more than can actually pay less if have luxury of time / patience.The lowest (non-lightning) price hit about $18.00 for 32GB $35 for 64GB early December. basically buy when price hits $20 less 64 nears $40.00.From December 2013 to January 2014 watched these cards change price almost daily basis. They initially went sale for about $17.95 $34.95 for 32 64 respectively. watched them slowly increase price random dips peaks for month.

Some cards won't boot because they're too slow too finicky all my Samsung UHS1s work great (the 64GB will not boot the Nook no 64GB card will).I keep my eyes open for price drops these cards because they've performed so well for me. Samsung also has newer faster card its price-point hovers somewhere north of &#34;prohibitive&#34; so still stick these.

AOEAD7DPLZE53,B007WTAJTO,NLee the Engineer,"[1428, 1505]",have tested dozens of SDHC micro-SDHC cards. One disturbing trend noticed that: speed class rating for micro-SDHC typically inflated. For example 'class-10' rating means card must deliver sequential write speed of least 10MB/s. somehow class-10 microSDHC cards always slower than class-10 SDHC card same manufacturer. Case point: thePNY 32 GB microSDHC Card (P-SDU32G10-EFS2)claims to 'class-10' yet can only write 8.6MB/s maximum while full-sizePNY P-SDHC16G10achieved 13.4MB/s according to CrystalDiskMark v3.01.ThisSanDisk Ultra 32 GB microSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 card (SDSDQUA-032G-U46A) however proves to exception. achieved sequential write speed of over 10MB/s according to two different benchmark programs (11.8MB/s ""CrystalDiskMark"" 10.6MB/s ""H2testw v1.4""). faster than all my other microSDHC cards including two 'class-10' cards fromPNYandPolaroid.A closer look file transfer speed using ""Flash Memory Toolkit"" revealed another nice surprise: For writing small files Sandisk Ultra microSDHC card performed as well as its full-size counterpart theSanDisk Ultra SDHC (SDSDU-032G-AFFP). In contrast all my other class-10 microSDHC cards perform poorly while writing smaller files. See benchmark results uploaded to 'Customer Images' for details.When use memory card digital camera to record HD video needs to store huge video file each session. That means its sequential write speed most critical. When used tablet smart phone however card's random write speed for small files more important. That's why such applications Sandisk microSDHC will perform faster than PNY Polaroid cards even though also rated as 'class-10'.[Bottom Line]As of writing Sandisk Ultra microSDHC card ia actually priced lower than other class-10 cards PNY Polaroid. makes Sandisk best value - especially if need honest class-10 performance across all platforms.[Side Notes]- Do not confuse Sandisk Ultra card withSanDisk Mobile Ultra microSDHC (SDSDQY-032G-U46A). The latter rated for class-6 only.- The size of '32GB' card 29.7GB according to my computer. actually normal because computer people count one Gig as ""2 to power 30"" which 7.3% larger than one billion. 29.7GB translates to 31.9 billion bytes which '32GB' according to marketing people.[Update Feb 4 2013]1. Amazon combined Sandisk Ultra 32GB 64GB cards same product page. Please beware your intended appliance must compatible 'SDXC' order to used 64GB version. My original review refers to 32GB 'SDHC' version.2. There two part numbers for same card. If start Amazon product page select 'Retail Packaging' you'll see part number of SDSDQUA-032G-U46A. if click 'Frustration Free Package' part number changes to SDSDQU-032G-AFFP-A.[Update Oct 5 2013]The Sandisk microSDHC card works great my new Samsung Galaxy S3 without need for reformat (the default format FAT32)[Update Dec 26 2013]My old test results limited by card reader USB 2.0 port used. re-tested Sandisk UHS1 micro card using theTranscend RDF5 Card Readerconnected to USB 3.0 port.

(Read below)Firstly need to aware Samsung Tablet Model GT-P5113 currently runs Android OS 4.1.1 Kernel 3.0.31-523998 Build number JRO03C.P5113UECLK7.(Jelly Bean) My experiences shared level of Android OS your experiences may vary depending what version of OS running. The SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC card purchased Amazon (Retail Packaging) gets recognized fine however when tablet's Media Device A.K.A 'MTP' application attempts to talk your PC via USB cable Tablet simply reboots! after card presented to PC. - Really strange indeed!This baffled me for couple of hours. Firstly attempted to format card (exFAT) PC formatted fine. After attempted to use tablet to see same behavioral oddity of instantaneous reboot of tablet as 'MTP' application tries to communicate PC. made me investigate issue further determined root cause fact SANDISK now seen to factory format card 'exFAT' also somehow seen to include 'offset' of 16MB beginning of card which shows up as 16MB unallocated region initial sectors card under windows disk management tool.The solution to get rid of 'unallocated' 16MB partition card. You could do PC might require some windows command line experience using 'diskpart' utility what not do not want to confuse people process. For most novice users The process should simple Just insert card tablet use 'native' SD Card format tool under 'settings' Android OS 4.1.1 has will get rid of 16MB partition happily remount Now after simple process 'MTP' application works fine PC to transfer files to SD card without any strange reboot phenomenon.Not sure why SANDISK formats their Class 10 card fashion (They never did with their class 6 cards earlier) there's gotta some technical explanation for why include 16MB partition only SANDISK can give. In end if reformat card tablet (Which defaults to exFAT) card seen to work fine.Bottomline:-----------This awesome 64GB capacity MicroSD card reputed manufacturer for budget minded people gets the job done beautifully. The read write speeds adequate enough for most AudioVideo & picture file formats tablet. The glitch mentioned above forced me to give *Four* stars instead of *Five* stars let not stop from making a decision to buy it.Highly recommended!Cheers!",4.0,Works with GT-P5113 Samsung Tab 2!,1370390400,2013-05-06,581,2,2

AVBMZZAFEKO58,B007WTAJTO,SkincareCEO,"[1568, 1694]","NOTE: please read last update (scroll to bottom) - leaving review as 1 star as appears to help others who purchased had similar experience.I give SanDisk 5 stars for customer service 1 star for product (for those manufactured past) For those newly manufactured products contain software ROM fix I'd give product 5 stars.To all those who purchased card due to all great reviews.... then used Galaxy S4 (GS4) smartphone for storage solution to problem not one can solve without returning card to SanDisk for replacement under warranty. Believe me tried everything Google searches returned as solutions... formatting as exFAT formatting GS4 then copying data to card while phone etc.... nothing worked... so now please stop pulling out your hair hopefully will get same result which hope to get soon (just RMA'd will send back tomorrow for free replacement under warranty).The problem (As confirmed SanDisk customer support rep when asked specifically asked him):- When used GS4 card will unmount itself inadvertently (may true only for cards manufactured before ROM patch described below implemented manufacturing). can cause data to become corrupt (luckily not my experience) / can frustrating as most of us saving 13 MP camera pictures to card (or MP4 movies stop middle of movie) unmounts when view picture gallery worse right when take picture (this issue experienced).- SanDisk knows about issue. Again SANDISK KNOWS ABOUT THE ISSUE AND WILL REPLACE YOUR CARD. Call them (info below) WILL take care of under warranty. They have good name for reason want to keep (sorry SanDisk about 1 star thought way to get message out to those searching for solution)- The customer rep told me SanDisk tried to work Samsung to resolve issue Samsung refused to acknowledge problem exists card some of their phones (especially their flagship GS4 phones).- The customer rep told me to their knowledge card works fine regular cameras (not Samsung GS4 phones cameras obviously) even worked fine some phones HTC etc. could accommodate 64 GB cards. Hence 5 star ratings others.- The solution SanDisk came up to write patch into ROM of card itself to specifically address issue Samsung GS4 phones (and maybe other Samsung phones GS3). assured new card would get would work flawlessly. will see about 3 weeks.- purchased my card Amazon June 2013 so ones currently being manufactured one should get will have new patch. However as SanDisk manufactures batches (like most of industry) old batches of ""unpatched"" cards obviously exist warehouses.- asked about software patch could download told it's not possible... hence ""hard coded patch"" card's ROMSo... how to take care of problem....After speaking SanDisk US customer support (link info below) what learned did.Go to SanDisk site1) [...]2) call consumer products support (this US no.) 1-866-SANDISK (726-3475)3) Tell them card unmounting itself your GS4 (I assume also problem experienced by GS3 owners too)4) They will then confirm your information approve your return (10-15 min approval window by mine basically instantaneously) then send emails UPS return label instructions.5) BTW also asked if had magnifying glass to ID serial no. card didn't couldn't read myself (those numbers super small printed into plastic... don't me? take look yourself.) told rep couldn't read them said no problem would process without serial no. assume because send new replacement card only when receive your card send in. Makes sense.Well that's Problem (hopefully) solved. Let's see 2-3 weeks. The rep super nice about seemed all too familiar problem. KUDOS TO SANDISK FOR TAKING CARE OF IT... however would nice if there some type of communication / notice of issue besides Google info sources forums etc. spent hours maybe couple of days total hours worth thinking issue my phone / my data transfer. oh well that's how goes.I hope review helps some of out there same problem as me. GOOD LUCK!!(btw I'd give card 5 stars if problem solved patched ROM of newer cards as data transfer speeds awesome card (tested transferring data via card reader hooked to my computer)... if data transfer / remaining mounted GS4 issue never existed (pre-patch of ROM of course))UPDATE: 08/17/2013 - All went well return of SanDisk Storage card. UPS shipping took about 2 days when sent SanDisk verified warranty claim 1 day later 5 hours later same day my replacement card had been shipped. waiting new card now expect to test out soon (early next week). will update post after testing out new card. Just as reference been using 32GB Micro SD HC SanDisk card GS4 since having shipped 64GB card. Obviously it's different card not Micro SD XC kind. Other than bit slower access speeds to card zero problems.... well if don't count it's basically filled up hence why 64GB option great GS4. proves point problem early build Micro SD XC 64GB cards.I'm happy to see my review has helped some others out there. Good luck to your warranty claim. my experience SanDisk customer support has been excellent so far.Update: 08/21/2013 - Received new replacement SanDisk Storage card few days ago (shipping back to me once agreed defective short time window). Have had running Galaxy S4 for few days now without any jumps stutters card unloading middle of picture video taking. Card seems to work flawlessly as SanDisk Rep mentioned would.

After receiving my card inserting into my new android tablet Jelly Bean recognized did show had 59GB available. then removed card tablet inserted into my computers Win7 Vista tried to transfer files photos videos my laptop to card WOULD NOT TRANSFER! After some research internet appeared card had to reformatted new ""exFAT32"" to standard FAT32. All my files created Win XP Win Vista - FAT32. also have Win7 machine recently purchased can easily move all types of files between all machines memory cards flash drives could not transfer any files to card any computer as long as card formatted exFAT32. had read internet about reformatting cards working. My Win7 machine does not even have option to format to standard FAT32 only has NSTF exFAT32. My older computers have older FAT32 format option took my Vista computer Dual Core processor 1 hours to reformat card to FAT32. After reformatting able to easily transfer my files photos videos my XP Vista computers BUT not Win7 computer. The card works my tablet am able to access use all files transferred to card FAT32 my Vista computer tablet. BUT after reformatting now card only has 27GB of space available so essentially reformatted 64GB card into 32GB card. will keep card because have lot of work into reformatting transferring files hopefully future can reformat again back to exFAT32 if when exFAT32 catches OS made can seamlessly use files created both FAT32 exFAT32. seems to good card works well certain situations my advice do your research what have how will use card because not simply big GB card can used for everything every device unless ALL your files photos videos will created exFAT32 there some real draw backs to card might better off buying multiple lower GB cards if need much storage space Micro SD card. Or perhaps cards already own can reformatted into exFAT32 double capacity if your computer has exFAT32 reformat option. have not tried based my experience last few days seems would work if exFAT32 works for you. gave 3 stars because does work I feel Sandisk not fully explaining how getting 64GB out of this card the possible problems a consumer might have misleading advertising.",3.0,Works but BEWARE exFAT32,1376956800,2013-08-20,475,1,1

A1WTQUOQ4WG9AI,B007WTAJTO,"Tom Henriksen ""Doggy Diner""","[82, 109]","Hi:I ordered two card arrived next day even faster than Prime. Unfortunatey 64gb MicroSD card designed to only work ex-fat. If you're ex-fat fan don't ever plan to change card for you. been able to take all of previous 64gb MicroSD cards ordered put them adapter format them my Windows 7 desktop. NTSF fan find to much more stable tablets.With other cards aren't intentionally crippled can format card to NTSF Monday ex-fat Tuesday Fat32 Wednesday. It's ex-fat highway for SanDisk.You can use EaseUS Partition Master to format card to Fat32 for devices such as cameras mp3 players many many many others don't support ex-fat. That being said only get one shot. Once it's formatted into Fat32 attempting to format back to Exfat NTSF hoses card. couldn't reformat to NTSF no matter what tried. Once again don't bother trying to format your computer ex-fat only choice.Any card needs special utility to format to anything other than ex-fat shouldn't supported. Don't buy it! It's designed to fail.Shame Sandisk!Update 9/24/12:***************************I spoke Sandisk technical support confirmed Sandisk Ultra 64gb MicroSd cards not compatible Android 4.0 above. would for Class 10 SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s Adapter SDSDQUA-064G-U46A as well as SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 30MB/s Memory Card SD Adapter (NEW VERSION) - Retail Packaging Komputerbay SDXC USB Reader.I did not have any success formatting class 10 card EaseUS Partition Master. SanDisk recommended free utility HPUSBDISK.exe successfully downloaded Softpedia. unable to format card NTSF successfully converted one of cards to Fat32 for friend who wants to use SanDisk mp3 player of course not compatible ex-fat.Acting Sandisk advice am returning unopened class ten cards KomputerBay reader. spoke patient gracious tier-one tech support person party line seems consumers only use MicroSD cards phones. don't know what they're thinking: cameras mp3 players tablets adapters so on. Anyway it's known issue.I can confirm class 6 64gb MicroSD card can formatted Windows7 back forth to most any format so after returning four class 10 cards back to class six.It's still unconscionable to deliberately design these cards to incompatible. hope SanDisk will come up solution recall cards. Buyer beware.Update: 9/29/12**********************I received my two replacement class 6 64gb MicroSD cards took less than five minutes to open horrible packaging to perform quick format to NTSF. Done!I gave my friend Class 10 64gb MicroSD card formatted into Fat32 by HPUSBDISK.EXE couldn't read his computer. As turns out class 10 cards not only incompatible most devices bur also most usb card readers. Another trip across town.I can confirm IOGEAR SD/MicroSD/MMC Card Reader/Writer GFR204SD (Green/Gray) selling Amazon for $6.99 works. after countless hours of wasted effort my friend has card formatted to Fat32 works SanDisk mp3 player.Once again SanDisk has admitted these cards not compatible Androd 4.0 above being 100% of Android tablets majority of Android phones. These cards intentionally crippled by design.To quote friend:""Per SDHC standard format FAT32. SDXC (64 GB larger) spec calls for exFAT. Microsoft has limited OS to only format larger cards as exFAT will not allow FAT32. Also seems have found way to also block NTFS. Thus far few Android devices can read exFAT because refuse to pay M$ for licensing of exFAT file system. ""To all masochists out there--buy card.

The only missing super high capacity internal removable storage affordable price. 128GB micro SD announcement finally filled gap supported by amazon current sale of $119 shipped question still remained if some of older smartphones will able to handle/recognize capacity. personally curious considering original Note 2 spec calling for support of up to 64GB only.Now about card itself. Its their Ultra edition read speeds of up 30MB/s Class 10 performance. As part of Ultra edition it's considered to waterproof temperature-proof x-ray-proof magnet-proof also shockproof. In addition to flash card itself also includes SD adapter for compatibility digital cameras also direct reading laptops/PCs support SD card.So comes verdict: IT WORKS Note 2!!! My Note 2 all stock Verizon SCH-I605 version running stock Android 4.3. checked card first adapter my laptop then mounted my Note 2 where recognized right capacity. also ran A1 SD Benchmark app (both long accurate benchmark tests) to verify success. Read/write speed not quite near 30MB/s it's still pretty good.My opinion? card takes multimedia powerhouse Note 2 to next level!!! Now don't have to limited can store your favorite albums FLAC audio format have small library of your favorite movies stored permanently take more high def videos so on.
